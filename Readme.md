# Wordfind
*forked from [bunkat](https://github.com/bunkat/wordfind)*

_Wordfind_ is a simple `javascript` library for generating (hopefully fun) word find (also known as word search) puzzles. Just give it a set of words and a few milliseconds later it will spit out a puzzle containing those words.

The core `wordfind.js` library contains no dependencies and will work both in the browser and in node.js. The repository also includes a fully functional word find game (aptly called `wordfindgame.js`) as an example. The game has a dependency on `jQuery`.

This is a fork of https://github.com/bunkat/wordfind allowing to specify the filling letters you want.

Check out the sample game at http://Lucas-C.github.com/wordfind/.

# GitHub Corners
*forked from [tholman](https://github.com/tholman/github-corners)*

Phew, GitHub is over ten years old now... and is unquestionably synonymous with open source. After 10 years, those GitHub ribbons are more than overdue for a cleaner, more modern alternative. [This is my take.](http://tholman.com/github-corners)

By using SVG, these corners can be clean and sharp. Any color, and size. As well as have a little character and interactivity!

You can build your own with the [SVGs](https://github.com/tholman/github-corners/tree/master/svg), copy some of the pre-defined code, or just change the `fill` and `color` values on the main `<svg>` element.

### Screenshot

You can see the page here... but I really recommend [visiting the page](http://tholman.com/github-corners) to see the small animations that really make them come to life.
